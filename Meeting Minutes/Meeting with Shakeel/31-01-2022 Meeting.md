# 31-01-2022 Meeting

* Textbooks recommended:
  * **An Introduction to Statistical Learning:** mix of theory and practice, see chapter 10 on deep learning and in particular 10.5 on RNNs.
  * **Deep Learning with Python:** entirely practical (written by the person who came up with Keras), see chapter 6 on deep learning for sequences; you may also be interested in section 3.3 on setting up a deep learning workstation.
  * **Neural Networks and Deep Learning:** all theory, see chapter 7 on RNNs and in particular 7.5 on LSTMs.
  * **An Introduction to Analysis of Financial Data with R:** mix of theory and practice, you will mostly be interested in reading chapters 5 and 6 (GARCH and ARCH).
* Tasks for next meeting: 
  * Obtain data and produce a notebook of exploratory analysis. (**Eddie and Joynal**)
  * Begin researching the models (ARCH, RNN, LSTM, etc.) you will fit to the data. (**Josh and Shahzeb**)
  * Decide on metrics for comparing fitted models. (**Anyone**)
  * Add some basic structure to your GitHub repo. (**Anyone**)
